## gameplay

* Answer the trivia questions by selecting the radio buttons, they are generated through the Open Trivia Database API
* If you lose, you will see the correct answer, and regardless, a gif celebrating or mocking your result will appear
    * this GIF is also pulled in from the Giphy API
* After ten rounds you will be informed whether you won or lost the game based on whether you achieved at least 7 correct answers

## development

* The assignment called for hard-coded questions and fixed gifs, this usees an API for both. 
* There is some goofiness with the API that is pulling in info, most of the questions have only four results, but there is no way to filter for questions, I'm still looking into workarounds for this

## other info

I am the sole maintainer of this code.
